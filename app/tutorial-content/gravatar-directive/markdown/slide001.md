$('#code').explode(); is a term I use whenever I come across a new technology or framework that has the ability to totally disrupt the way I write code on a daily basis. AngularJS is one such framework.

Since adopting AngularJS I've been able to reduce the amount of code I write to create Single Page Apps by almost a third of what I did with other popular MVC frameworks and over half of what it took with jQuery.

Don't get me wrong, those other frameworks and libraries are great and they have their place in front-end development, but AngularJS provides you with the tools that you need to build Single Page Apps all in one place, there is no need to bring in a bunch of other libraries just to get the core functionality for a Single Page App.
