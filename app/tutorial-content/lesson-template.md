## Applies to
<<List the most directly relevant product or technologies this code example applies to. Unlike technology attribute, this section can contain any combination of items.>>

## Summary
<<Insert 3-5 lines max description of the intent of the code example, highlighting when to use and key scenarios.>>

## Objectives
<<Insert bulleted list of task-based outcomes for the code example. List the user objectives for choosing this code. List the intent of the code.>>

## Scenarios
<<Insert a bulleted list of example usage scenarios you have seen this code used in practice.>>

## Solution Example
<<Insert commented code illustrating the solution. Insert code example as a blob within a function. The blob allows quick reading of the code. It also allows quickly testing from a function, inlining within other code, or refactoring for a given context. The alternative is to factor up front, but this increases complexity and can negatively impact consumption. This leaves refactoring to the developer for their given scenario.>>
