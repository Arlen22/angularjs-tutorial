To publish a message is pretty simple, first we need to include a dependency to the requestNotificationChannel in our controller, service or directive. You can see this in the dataService definition below. When an event occurs in the component that needs to signal others that a change has occurred, you just need to call the appropriate notification method on the requestNotificationChannel. If you look at the saveHop, deleteHop and addHop methods of the dataService, you'll see they all call the dataUpdated method on the requestNotificationChannel which will then signal the listeners who have registered with the onDataUpdated method.
