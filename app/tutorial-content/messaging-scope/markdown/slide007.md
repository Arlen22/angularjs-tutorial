Receiving event notifications from the requestNotificationChannel is just as simple, except we need to pass in a callBack handler that will do something with the notification once the message is sent. Again we will need to add a dependency to the requestNotificationChannel to our controller, service or directive, you can see this in the code for the view1-controller below. Next we need to define an event callback handler that will respond to the event notification. Next we need to register our callback handler with the requestNotificationChannel by calling onDataUpdated and passing in the scope from our controller and the callback handler.
